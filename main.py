''' Simple Text Adventure Game!
    Game takes place in a castle, created with a map.
    Player can choose to move around the map and to look around.
    Players goal is to find and open a treasure chest.
    In order to open the teasure chest the player must find and take a key.
    Every time the game is started the key will be placed in a randon room;
    this is possible beucase the program imported a random library.
    The map is make with an array(nested lists). 
    Each Map item is a type of tile.
    Tile detalies are stored in a nested dictionary(database).
    Odjects characteristics and current statues are stored in a nested 
    dictionary(databases).
    Player has an inventory created by an empty list.
    Some objects can be picked up and added to the players inventory.
    Players can quit the game at anytime, the game will end using sys.exit()
    a funtion that is imported with the sys library.
    All of the players choices are confirmed by printing relivant messages to
    the consol. Lots of messages repeat so there is a dictionary of common
    messages that can be referenced and used throught the code.
